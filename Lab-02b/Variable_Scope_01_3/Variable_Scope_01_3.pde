/*Understanding variable scope
To fix to variable scope 01-2

There is a problem with the code. In the ellipse 
method, the width and height are absolute values 
(the negative sign is droppedâ€¦processing only 
cares about the magnitude).

To handle this logic bug, we need to stop reducing 
the diameter by 10 when we reach a certain value, 
say 20.
*/
//The diameter variable is now global scope
int diameter = 100;

void setup() 
{
  size(500,400);
  background(0);
  stroke(255);
  fill(45,45,45); 
}

void draw() 
{
  //boolean condition added to stop reducing the diameter when it reaches 20.
  if ((mousePressed) && (diameter > 20))
  {
    diameter = diameter - 10;
    background(0);
  }
  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, diameter, diameter);
}
